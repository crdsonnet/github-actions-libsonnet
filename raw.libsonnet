It also assures that your workflow should still work.\n- Using the master branch of an action may be convenient, but if someone releases a new major version with a breaking change, your workflow could break.\nSome actions require inputs that you must set using the with keyword. Review the action's README file to determine the inputs required.\nActions are either JavaScript files or Docker containers.
